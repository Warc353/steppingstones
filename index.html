	<h1>Welcome to Stepping Stones!</h1>
		<p>Stepping Stones is a licensed, nonprofit preschool and daycare located in Farmville, VA. 
		At Stepping Stones, our goal is to provide high-quality, affordable programs for children ages 
		6 weeks to 12 years in a safe, "play and learn" environment that stimulates and nurtures children's 
		academic, social, emotional, and physical growth.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>We are fully licensed according to Department of Social Services Standards
			 by the Commonwealth of Virginia.</li>
			<li>Our small class sizes and low student-teacher ratios allow for us to 
			provide individual attention and customized care to meet your child's needs.
			</li>
			<li>Our teachers have over 40 years combined professional childcare experience.
			</li>
			<li>We are a nonprofit organization, governed by a Board of Directors 
			composed of the parents of Stepping Stones' students and alumni. 
			Parents who--just like you--want to ensure the highest quality learning and 
			care environment for their children.
			</li>
		</ul>
